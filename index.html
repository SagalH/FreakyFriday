        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Access to clean drinking water and sanitation vs not having it can be the difference between having a good, healthy and dignified life. Yet something as crucial and essential is hardly accessible to 4.2 billion. That compromises around 1/2 of the worlds population not having one of their basic human rights fulfilled.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Water scarcity and sanitation is not only a health issue, but a quality of life one. Thats why the challenges connected to it must be tackle. 
            The challenges are not about a global lack of clean water, but a distributon and priorites problem.

        <h2>Inequality</h2>
        <p>
            Even though the distribution and handling of such a quintessential resource as water is already unequal between poor and rich countries. That also trickles down to poor communities, and how it disproportionately effects young girls and women. 
There are obvious hygiene, pregnancy and childbearing reasons as to why. But women also tend to take on the labour of collecting water, which is time consuming and tiresome. 
And even on the occasions when they might have access to using an open toilet they may face attacks or abuse on the way.
